# CJD

CJD is a system for documenting Clojure programs through the use of structured 
comments embedded in Clojure source code. As such, it's a supplement to or replacement
for the docstring mechanism. 

CJD was inspired by Javadoc, to which it bears superficial similarity. Like Javadoc,
CJD-comments support a simple form of markup. This allows CJD's processing facility
to extract the documentation content from collections of Clojure namespaces and convert 
it into trees of consistently-formatted HTML documents. 

For a not-terribly-reverent introduction to CJD, 
[try the FAQ](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/FAQ.html).

If you'd like to see what it looks like in the real world, the CJD source is 
itself extensively commented using CJD. The  CJD HTML tree is available in both 
[dark-background](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/dark/index.html) and
[light-background](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/light/index.html) renderings.
For a representative sample of what CJD is and does, try
[the generated output](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/dark/cjd.exome.html) and 
[the source code](https://github.com/greenh/CJD/blob/master/src/clojure/cjd/exome.clj) 
from which it was generated. 

## Documentation
Several documents are in the making:

* A [user guide](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/User.html), which attempts to explain 
how to use and customize CJD. It's still a work in progress, so beware.

* A [quick reference](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/QuickRef.html) to CJD markup
elements. 

* A [FAQ](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/FAQ.html), which discusses a number of issues
about what CJD is and does, and how it managed to get there.

* CJD's program documentation, as generated by CJD, in your choice of 
[dark background](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/dark/index.html) or 
[light background](http://greenh.github.com/CJD/doc/light/index.html).

## Status

The CJD document processor is essentially fully 
operational. The user guide is mostly in place, although the sections on extending CJD
still have a way to go. 

Limitations:

* Currently tested only with Clojure 1.4.0, but has historically worked with 1.2.1 and 1.3.0.

* Requires Java 6 or above.

* Currently tested with Leiningen 2.x only. Lein 1.x support is still there and even might work.
